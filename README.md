# stcp
This is a simple, lightweight, and cross-platform TCP/IP library written in C

When compiling on Windows, link against `ws2_32`

First initialize the library with `stcp_initialize();`. There are two basic structures, `stcp_server` and `stcp_channel`, which represent a TCP server and client, respectively. Both of these need an `stcp_address` and a port to create. Only ipv4 and hostnames are supported. Servers can accept pending channels, and channels can send/receive data. Note that for send/receive, a timeout of 0 does not block the caller. However, a timeout of -1 blocks the caller until the task is completed.

The user can also handle errors with `stcp_set_error_callback(cb, user_data)`. The callback function returns void takes two parameters, an `stcp_error` for the error code and a `void*` for the user data. 

Here's an example. In a real program, remember to check for errors:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "stcp.h"

int main()
{
	stcp_initialize();

	const int timeout_ms = 500;
	const int port = 80;
	const char* request = "HEAD / HTTP/1.2\r\n\r\n";
	const char* hostname = "www.google.com";
	char buffer[1024];

	stcp_address* addr = stcp_create_address_hostname(hostname, port);
	stcp_channel* channel = stcp_create_channel(addr);

	stcp_send(channel, request, strlen(request), timeout_ms);
	int bytes_received = stcp_receive(channel, buffer, sizeof(buffer), timeout_ms);
	if (bytes_received > 0)
		fwrite(buffer, bytes_received, 1, stdout)

	stcp_free_address(addr);
	stcp_free_channel(channel);
	stcp_terminate();
	return 0;
}
```
I don't think a license is needed for this. Just don't do anything stupid <3
